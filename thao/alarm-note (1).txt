This technical note explains how to interface the RACO Verbatim Gateway system with the Allen-Bradley
MicroLogix 1100 and 1400 models of PLCs Via Ethernet.
Both the MicroLogix 1100 and 1400 PLC contain an Ethernet/1P
port. This port along with the 1761-NET-ENI allows the ' fig ‘ .32
Verbatim Gateway to perform its alarm notifications and K
monitoring functions using the existing wiring to Allen-Bradley
MicroLogix 1100 and 1400 PLCs as inputs via Ethernet. This 1
technical note is applicable for all Verbatim Gateway models.
RACO-supplied components:
Verbatim Gateway (any model)
51oVAB-1 Cable (NOTE: should modify cable to replace the 9 pin D-SUB with 8-pin mini din)
Allen-Bradley-supplied components:
MicroLogix 1100 or 1400 PLC
l76l-CBL-PMo2 (R8232 programming cable)
176l-NET-ENI (DFI to Ethernet protocol converter)
copy of ENI/ENIW Utility software (available free via www.AB.com)
either a crossover Ethernet cable or standard Ethernet cable connected through a Hub/Switch.
RSLogix 500 software version 8.10.00
In order to facilitate Ethernet communications, RACO provides a serial cable that connects the Verbatim
Gateway to the l761-NET-ENI. This cable has the RJ-45 connector required at the Verbatim Gateway end and
the 8-pin mini at the other end that connects to Port 2 (R8232) of the 1761-NET-ENI card.
Once this cable is connected, only Ethernet related hardware is required.
