    <h4>What is SR&ED?</h4>
    SR & ED stands for Scientific Research and Experimental Development. It refers to activities performed by a company for the purposes of research and development. These can include developing a new concept, working on new projects or making innovations to an existing product or service.

    <h4>What is the SR&ED Tax incentive program?</h4>
    The Canadian government provides tax credits and refunds to businesses of all types and sizes that perform research and development work in Canada. This program benefits business both by allowing a business to deduct certain expenses from their income for tax evaluation, and by providing a tax credit that reduces that amount of taxes you pay, and can even result in a refund.

    <h4>How do I know if I qualify?</h4>
    Any business that performs activities of scientific research, applied research or experimental development is eligible for this program. The criteria for work that is considered to be SR&ED is identified in section 248(1) of the Income Tax Act.
    Essentially, eligible work includes basic research for the purpose of scientific knowledge, scientific researched performed for a specific application, or work that is done with the intention of advancing and improving technologies, materials, devices, or processes within a specific industry. You donâ€™t even need to have been successful in your SR&ED activities. As long as you have incurred SR&ED expenses in a legitimate attempt to succeed, you could qualify.

    <h4>Where does CTS and Associates come in?</h4>
    CTS & Associates will analyze and evaluate your companies eligibility for an SR&ED tax credit. Once your eligibility is affirmed, we will obtain the necessary technical data and financial data from you, prepare/finalize the claim in accordance with CRA requirements and file the claim within necessary deadlines. We will liaise with CRA in the processing/claim approval process to ensure that you receive all of the money to which your company is entitled.
