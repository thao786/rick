    <hr class="style-three">

    	<p>For many decades manufacturers have been retrieving production, quality and productivity data from the shop floor by way of the trusty cllpboard.</p>
		<p>The computer age has only slowly infiltrated the area of shop floor data retrieval.Not until well into the 1990’s did powerful SCADA software arrive on the scene. Software developers had found an opportunity to provide the non-programmer with a means to retrieve and display process data.</p>
		<br>

		<p>The successful marketing of SCADA products was boosted by advancements in technology.</p>
		<p>The mid and late 90's was a period of technology revolutions. High speed Pentium III driving the 32 bit “Windows” operating system coupled with low cost memory and hard drive capacity allowed SCADA applications to grow in complexity, offering high-resolution charts, reparts, and graphics. Improved networkability of operating systems along with the advent of the Internet brought “High speed” and “Broad Band" capabilities to the world of SCADA.</p>
		<br>

		<p>Only recently are users coming to the realization that SCADA applications, while being able to offer all this sizzle and glitz, are only software.</p>
		<p>Many SCADA houses are well able to provide their customers with support to configure and implement reports, charts, screens, menus and even some fundamental code.</p>
		<p>However there are important considerations to be addressed outside the realm of PC software. Integration into existing manufacturing controls can be complex and requires specialized knowledge.</p>
		<br>

		<p>We understand the many issues software, electrical, and mechanical that your organization will have to face during SCADA integration.</p>
		<p>We will help your company reach the goal of complete integration of plant data collection.</p>
		<p>Our staff of electricians, technicians, millwrights, and information technology personnel know how to get the job done. We are much more than a simple software integrator: Whether your company wishes to implement an off the shelf SCADA package or have us previde custom applications, Webtronics Automation has the in-house resources achieve the goal.</p>
		<br>

		<p>Proper organization is crucial to the success of any type of software implementation. This is especially so when implementing SCADA. SCADA can and should be made available for mum-departmental use. Perhaps Quality Assurance has an interest in monitoring defect rates, scrap rates and process yields. Perhaps automating SPC is a goal. Production would like to identify manufacturing bottlenecks and productivity issues.</p>
		<p>Production rates and order tracking are impartant here. Maintenance would like to be able to identify causes of unscheduled downtime. Knowledge of the correct number of machine cycles would make preventative maintenance scheduling more effective. Management would like to minimize material wastage and maximize worker productivity. Easy access to up to date information is crucial for effective decision making. Involving all manufacturing departments in the SCADA design and configuration process is a key to effective implementation. With departmental “wish lists” complete the task of identifying how to grant those wishes and consequently establishing the project scape begins. Evaluating whether or not your existing means of control can satisfy the wish list is the crucial next step.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the current control systems cannot access some cmcial process data. Conceivably the Etrumentation required to collect this data may not be compatible with the control system.</p>
		<br>

		<p>It’s has been said that knowing what you want is half the battle. Although knowing what you want is essential, it is also critical to determine whether or not what you want is already being measured. If this data is not currently accessible we must determine whether the existing PLC can accommodate additional instrumentation.</p>
		<p>Utilizing the existing PLC hardware is a cost effective approach but hardware limitations may prohibit placement of additional instrumentation into the existing control systems. If this is the case a decision must be made whether to upgrade, expand, or completely replace the existing controls.</p>
		<p>Other options such as stand-alone instruments can also be considered.</p>
		<br>

		<p>Collected data must be reliable and robust. This may require data conditioning within the PLC. Data accumulation and processing places only a small burden on the system resources of most current PLC designs.Alternatively if one were to attempt to apply system “watchdogs” to production lines from the PC platform, operating system resources and timing limitations could result in unreliable data acquisition. Some functions are inherently more reliable when performed at the level of process control.</p>
		<p>When modifying PLC code for data collectiOn it is important to separate the data collection/conditioning
		code from control-related code. Machine control and safety must always take priority. The data collection sub-routines may be called with every PLC proceSSOr scan or by timed interrupt. Executing code on a timed interval is generally more effective and efficient. For transient events it may be necessary to modify PLC code to "Latch" the condition so that the event is held long enough to be visible to the SCADA software.</p>
		<p>This is a notorious area of difficulty for SCADA software packages. Forced by necessity to read data from the PLC only every few milliseconds, shOrt duration events may not be captured. It may be reasonable to consider utilizing a supervisory PLC to gather data from the existing PLCs controlling the process.</p>
		<br>

		<p>A very critical SCADA component is data storage. Data that is graphed, logs events, or is sent to a report must reslde In some form of electronic storage. Transient data reporting on immediate conditions that have no relevance in the future need not be stored.</p>
		<p>Whether data is generated in the PC as a process "recipe" or retrieved from the machine/process, all non-immediate data must be safely stored in a database; i.e. “the backbone".</p>
		<p>Users can query the database by means of commercial database software or custom applications to retrieve data relevant to their needs.</p>
		<br>

		<p>Clearly there is far more to SCADA implementation that merely installing software on a PC.</p>
		Webtronics Automation will help you clear the fog of complexity surrounding SCADA implementation.</p>
		We will meet with you assess your SCADA needs and we will ptovide a one time, NO COST,plant evaluation.</p>
