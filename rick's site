What good is an airplane if you are a pilot and you can't make it go where you want it to go?

What good is a chemical products production line if you can't control temperature, pressure and pH in the process and you end up making tons of garbage?

What good is an oven if you can't control the temperature?  (And, does it matter if it's an oven in a kitchen or an oven in a heat-treating department that is used to harden metal parts?)

What good is a pump if you can't control the flow rate it produces?  (And, there are many times when the flow rate must be controlled.)
