2. scada: oil rig -> encounter rock -> increase power supply to meet demand
AVL: integrate a 40foot trailer stuffed lithium ion battery, design it to act as a solid state genset to work in parallell with existing either diesel or liquid natural gas genset (lng).

diesel genset is the standard electrical power generation at a remote oil n gas drill site. the problem with diesel genset is: 
1. environment isse: byproduct  benzene 
2. blackout n brownout. a drill site will lose power bcuz of steep fluctuation in load VS the reaction/response time of the genset
3. operate outside of optimal efficiency: when sizing diesel genset u have to provide full maximum load capability. rarely does the genset require full load at peak efficinecy as peak load happens rarely.

advantage of solid state genset:
1. instantaneous reponse of site load changes has the capability to keep existing genset running at peak efficiency. 
2. can allow for replacement of diesel. with working parallel

by combining solid state (battery) genset wt fossil fuel u can replace diesel.

3. scada: control of pharmaceutical assembly line
without scada system -> cant control temperature, pH leve, pressure -> making tons of garbage
